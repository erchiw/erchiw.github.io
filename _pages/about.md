I am a [Data Science](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Yu-Xiang Wang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yuxiangw/) and to work closely with Prof. [Yi-an Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home). 

My research focuses on differential privacy and machine learning, from theory to practice. Recently, I have being thinking how tecniques from differential privacy can address safety concerns in generative models. [My CV can be found here](/files/CV_ErchiWang.pdf).
